        Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
        Holmes is best known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and
        logical reasoning, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients.
        He has a flair for showmanship to impress observers. At times Holmes relaxes with music,
        either playing the violin, or enjoying the works of composers such as Wagner. The first set
        of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893.
